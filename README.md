# super-duper-robot
## Started by copying over challenge files into own repository
## Created Var Char sets in javascript code for Uppercase, lowercase, special and numeric characters
## Created  function to generate password by first using a prompt to determine character count for password
## Used If statement to send message if desired length doesnt fall between set parameters
## Next was coding so user could pick and choose which var sets were needed in password
## Next is once all char sets are chosen the function writes password in password field
